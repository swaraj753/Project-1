Stockholm GitHub Users Analysis
This project uses the GitHub API to scrape data on users in Stockholm with over 100 followers and their most recent repositories, with details on their profile and repository statistics.
One surprising finding was that a majority of active users tend to favor JavaScript, yet a notable portion includes projects with diverse language profiles.
To maximize visibility, developers could benefit from creating high-quality repositories with comprehensive documentation, as these tend to have higher engagement.
